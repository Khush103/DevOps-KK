# Security - Managing File Permissions and Ownership
- Whoever creates a file, namely the `user` at the time of creation, becomes the `owner` of that file by default. A `group` of users can also share ownership of a file. The `other` category essentially refers to anyone in the universe with access to your Linux machine.
- Only an official owner of a file is allowed to change its permissions.
- ls -l -> displays the file's (default) permissions: rw-r--r-- -> user-permissions(rw)-group-permissions(r)--others-permissions(r)--
- chmod go-r <file-name> ->  `go-r` is the permission change to be applied, which in this case means removing for the group (g) and others (o) the read (r) permission. 
- chmod -r <file-name> -> revokes the read permissions for all the users
- chmod +r <file-name> -> grants read permissions for all the users
- chmod o-r <file-name> -> revokes the read permissions only for others
- The chmod command can be used with both files and directories.
