# apt - advanced packaging tool
-sudo apt upgrade -> upgrades all available packages
- sudo apt install <package-name> -> install the specified package
- 

# pip -> python install package
- pip install <package-name>

# Special paths
~ - home directory
/ - root directory
. - present directory
.. - parent of present directory

# Comman Commands
- ps -e -> all running processes
- top -n 3 -> resource usage #top - table of processes
- man <any command> -> reference manual for any command
- date -> today's date
- uname -> operating system name
- cp -> copy file
- mv -> move file
- rf -> remove file
- rm -i -r <filename> -> remove a file and its child directoried
- rmdir -> remove empty directories
- touch file..file n-> create one or, nore empty files
- chmod -> change/modify file permissions
- wc <file-name> -> get count of the lines, words, characters in a file
- wc -l/-w/-c <file-name> -> for only counting lines/words/chars
- grep -> return lines in a file matching pattern
- find . -name "search-text"-> find files in the present directory
- sort <file-nem> display the lines of a file sorted alphanumerically
- sort -r <file-name> in reverse order
- uniq -> Drop consecutive duplicated lines and display result
## Basic text wrangling: extracting lines and fields
- grep <pattern> <file-name> -> specify a pattern and search for lines within a file that match that pattern
Option	Description
  -n	Along with the matching lines, also print the line numbers
  -c	Get the count of matching lines
  -i	Ignore the case of the text while matching
  -v	Print all lines which do not contain the pattern
  -w	Match only if the pattern matches whole words
- cut -> view only specific fields from each line of text in a file.
- cut -c -N <file-name> -> view only first N chars of each line
- cut -c N- zoo.txt -> view each line starting fron N-th char
- cut -d "," -f2 <file-name>  -> -d "," tells the command that the delimiter is a comma, and -f2 tells it to extract the second field.
- paste <file1> <file2> -> merge lines of multiple files together.
- paste -d ","<file1> <file2> -> change the delimeter from default space to comma

## Computer Networking
A computer network is a set of computers that are able to communicate with each other and share resources provided by network nodes (e.g. LANs, WANs, internet)
A network resource is any object, such as a file or document, which can be identified by the network.
A network node is any device that participates in a network.
A host is a special type of node in a computer network - it is a computer that can function as a server or a client on a network.
A server is a host computer that is able to accept a connection from a client host and fulfill certain resource requests made by the client.
Many hosts can perform either role, acting as both client and server.
A network packet is a formatted chunk of data that can be transmitted over a network.
Today's computer networks typically use communication protocols that are based on such packets of information. 
Every packet consists of two types of data: 1. the control information, and 2. the payload. 
The control information is data about how and where to deliver the payload, such as the source and destination network addresses, while the payload is the message being sent.
- ping -> command works by sending special 'echo request' packets to a host and waiting for a response from the host.

IP stands for "Internet Protocol" which defines the format of data transmitted over the internet or a local network.
An IP address is a code used to uniquely identify any host on a network.
A URL, more commonly known as a web address, stands for Uniform Resource Locator.




- rmdir -> removes an entire directory
- cat -> print file contents
- more -> print file contents page-by-page
- head -> print first N lines of a file
- tail -> print last N lines of a file
- df -h -> disk space
- wget -> downloading files from the web via HTTP, HTTPS, or FTP protocols.

# File compression and archiving
- tar -> archive a set of file
- zip -> compress a set of files
- unzip -> extract files from a compressed zip archive
# Networking
- hostname -> print hostname
- ping -> send packets to url and prints response
- ifconfig -> display or, config system network interfaces
- curl -> displays contents of file at a url
- wget -> download file from a url

# Security - Managing File Permissions and Ownership
- Whoever creates a file, namely the `user` at the time of creation, becomes the `owner` of that file by default. A `group` of users can also share ownership of a file. The `other` category essentially refers to anyone in the universe with access to your Linux machine.
- Only an official owner of a file is allowed to change its permissions.
- ls -l -> displays the file's (default) permissions: rw-r--r-- -> user-permissions(rw)-group-permissions(r)--others-permissions(r)--
- chmod go-r <file-name> ->  `go-r` is the permission change to be applied, which in this case means removing for the group (g) and others (o) the read (r) permission. 
- chmod -r <file-name> -> revokes the read permissions for all the users
- chmod +r <file-name> -> grants read permissions for all the users
- chmod o-r <file-name> -> revokes the read permissions only for others
- The chmod command can be used with both files and directories.
