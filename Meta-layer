Metadata is the core of the Yocto Project. Metadata has several important subdivisions:
- meta/classes/
These directories contain the .bbclass files. Class files are used to abstract common code so it can be reused by
multiple packages. Every package inherits the base file.

- meta/conf/
This directory contains the core set of configuration files that start from bitbake.conf and from which all other configuration
files are included. 

- meta/conf/machine/
This directory contains all the machine configuration files. If you set MACHINE = "qemux86", the OpenEmbedded
build system looks for a qemux86.conf file in this directory.

- meta/conf/distro/
The contents of this directory controls any distribution-specific configurations. For the Yocto Project, the defaultsetup.
conf is the main file here. This directory includes the versions and the SRCDATE definitions for applications
that are configured here.

- meta/conf/machine-sdk/
The OpenEmbedded build system searches this directory for configuration files that correspond to the value of SDKMACHINE.
By default, 32-bit and 64-bit x86 files ship with the Yocto Project that support some SDK hosts.

- meta/files/
This directory contains common license files and several text files used by the build system. The text files contain minimal
device information and lists of files and directories with known permissions.
