##### Arithmetic operators #####
x + y            Addition + operator returns the sum of x plus y
x - y             Subtraction - operator returns the difference of x minus y
x * y            Multiplication * operator returns the product of x times y
x / y             Division / operator returns the quotient of x divided by y
x**y            Exponent ** operator returns the result of raising x to the power of y 
x**2            Square expression returns x squared
x**3            Cube expression returns x cubed
x**(1/2)        Square root (½) or (0.5) fractional exponent operator returns the square root of x
x // y           Floor division operator returns the integer part of the integer division of x by y
x % y          Modulo operator returns the remainder part of the integer division of x by y

####### Built-in Functions ###########
* print(): The print() function outputs specified objects to the screen, allowing for easy display of information.
* sorted(): The sorted() function sorts the components of an iterable and returns them in a new list, without modifying the original iterable.
* type(): The type() function returns the data type of its argument, helping to track variable types and avoid errors.
* max(): The max() function returns the largest numeric input from multiple values or an iterable.
* str(): The str() function converts any data type to a string, returning its string representation.
* min(): The min() function returns the smallest numeric input from multiple values or an iterable.
* def() keyword: The purpose of the def() keyword is to define a new function.
* return() value: The value or variable returned as the end result of a function.


############# Comparision Operators #####
==   Equality operator  a == b  a is equal to b

!=  Not equal to operator   a != b  a is not equal to b

>  Greater than operator   a > b  a is larger than b

>=  Greater than or equal to operator   a >= b  a is larger than or equal to b

<  Less than operator    a < b  a is smaller than b

<= Less than or equal to operator   a <= b  a is smaller than or equal to b

####### Logical Operators ########
* and : The 'and' operator returns True only if both conditions are True.
* not : The 'not' operator inverts the Boolean value of the expression it precedes.
* or : The 'or' operator returns True if at least one of the conditions is True.
* Logical Operators: Logical operators are used to combine multiple comparison statements, returning a Boolean result of True or False.

##### Loops ######
while loop - Tells the computer to execute a set of instructions while a specified condition is True.

infinite loop - Missing a method for exiting the loop, causing the loop to run forever.

break - A break statement in Python provides a way to exit out of a loop before the loop's condition is false. 
Once a break statement is encountered, the program's control flow jumps out of the loop and continues executing the code after the loop.

pass - A pass statement in Python is a placeholder statement which is used when the syntax requires a statement,
but you don't want to execute any code or command.
