##### Arithmetic operators #####
x + y            Addition + operator returns the sum of x plus y
x - y             Subtraction - operator returns the difference of x minus y
x * y            Multiplication * operator returns the product of x times y
x / y             Division / operator returns the quotient of x divided by y
x**y            Exponent ** operator returns the result of raising x to the power of y 
x**2            Square expression returns x squared
x**3            Cube expression returns x cubed
x**(1/2)        Square root (½) or (0.5) fractional exponent operator returns the square root of x
x // y           Floor division operator returns the integer part of the integer division of x by y
x % y          Modulo operator returns the remainder part of the integer division of x by y

####### Built-in Functions ###########
* print(): The print() function outputs specified objects to the screen, allowing for easy display of information.
* sorted(): The sorted() function sorts the components of an iterable and returns them in a new list, without modifying the original iterable.
* type(): The type() function returns the data type of its argument, helping to track variable types and avoid errors.
* max(): The max() function returns the largest numeric input from multiple values or an iterable.
* str(): The str() function converts any data type to a string, returning its string representation.
* min(): The min() function returns the smallest numeric input from multiple values or an iterable.
* def() keyword: The purpose of the def() keyword is to define a new function.
* return() value: The value or variable returned as the end result of a function.


############# Comparision Operators #####
==   Equality operator  a == b  a is equal to b

!=  Not equal to operator   a != b  a is not equal to b

>  Greater than operator   a > b  a is larger than b

>=  Greater than or equal to operator   a >= b  a is larger than or equal to b

<  Less than operator    a < b  a is smaller than b

<= Less than or equal to operator   a <= b  a is smaller than or equal to b

####### Logical Operators ########
* and : The 'and' operator returns True only if both conditions are True.
* not : The 'not' operator inverts the Boolean value of the expression it precedes.
* or : The 'or' operator returns True if at least one of the conditions is True.
* Logical Operators: Logical operators are used to combine multiple comparison statements, returning a Boolean result of True or False.

##### Loops ######
- while loop - Tells the computer to execute a set of instructions while a specified condition is True.

- infinite loop - Missing a method for exiting the loop, causing the loop to run forever.

- break - A break statement in Python provides a way to exit out of a loop before the loop's condition is false. 
Once a break statement is encountered, the program's control flow jumps out of the loop and continues executing the code after the loop.

- pass - A pass statement in Python is a placeholder statement which is used when the syntax requires a statement,
but you don't want to execute any code or command.

- For Loop: 'For' loops are used to iterate over a sequence of values, 
allowing repeated execution of a block of code for each item in the sequence.

- Every for loop can also be written as a while loop. 


### range() function #####
* range() : The range() function generates a sequence of integers, which can be used in for loops to control iteration.
* Parameters of range(): The range() function can take up to three parameters: start (inclusive), stop (exclusive), and step (increment).
* range(start, stop, step)
* the end-of-range value is EXCLUDED from the range.
* Start parameter: The starting position of the range, defaulting to 0, which is included in the range.
* Step parameter: The incremental value for the range, defaulting to +1, which can be overridden.
* Stop parameter: The ending position of the range, which is exclusive and must be specified.
* The "in" keyword, when used with the range() function, generates a sequence of integer numbers, 
which can be used with a for loop to control the start point, the end point, and the incremental values of the loop.


#### Data Types #####
--------------- STRINGS -------------------------------
* strings - a sequence of characters and are often used to display output to the user. 
- strings are immutable, means once created, it cannot be modified.

...... String Methods ......
string.lower() - will return the string with all characters changed to lowercase. 
string.upper() - will return the string all in uppercase.
string.strip() - to remove surrounding whitespace from a string.
string.lstrip() & .rstrip() - to remove whitespace only from the left or the right side of the string
string.count() - to return the number of times a substring appears in a string.
string.endswith.() - This will return True if the substring is found at the end of the string, and False if not.
string.isnumeric() - can check if a string is composed of only numbers. 
string.join() - method to concatenate strings
string.split() - allows us to split a string into a list of strings. 
string.replace(old, new) - Returns a new string where all occurrences of old have been replaced by new.
string.format() - to concatenate and format strings in all kinds of powerful ways. 
            To do this, create a string containing curly brackets, {}, as a placeholder, to be replaced. 
            Then call the format method on the string using .format() and pass variables as parameters. 
            The variables passed to the method will then be used to replace the curly bracket placeholders. 
            This method automatically handles any conversion between data types for us. 
          - {:.2f} means that you’d format this as a float number, with two digits after the decimal dot.
          - {:>3.2f} would align the text three spaces to the right, as well as specify a float number with two decimal places.


* for character in string: Iterates over each character in the string.
* string[i]: Accesses the character at index i of the string, starting at zero.
* len(string): Returns the length of the string.
