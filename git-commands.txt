- git config --global user.name "user name" #swt your user name

- git config --global user.email "your email" #set your user email

- git config --list #view current git config

- du -sh <folder-name> #disc space of a folder

- git init #initialize a new repo

- git branch <branch name> #create a new branch

- git checkout -b <branch name> #create and switch to new branch

###Syncing with Remote####
- git remote -v #list connected remotes
- git pull  #fetch and merge from remote
- git push  #push local commits to remote
- git push -u origin <branch> #Push new branch and set upstream tracking


###Undoing and Fixing Mistakes
- git log
- git diff #to see unstages changes
- git reset <file> to unstage a file
- git reset --hard <commit> #reset to a specific commit (destructive)
- git revert <commit> #create a new commit that undoes a previous commit


# Rebasing #reapply commits on the top of another base commit
git rebase <upstream>



- git log -n #to see the last n commits

- git show <commit-hash> #to see the details of a perticular commit

- git blame <filename> #shows who last modified each line of a file

- git fetch #to download changes (commits, branches and tags) from remote 

      ~ git fetch [remote -->> origin] [branch]
- git pull <remote> <branch> # fetch changes from remote repo and merge them in to your current branch

- git merge <branch-name> #to merge the specified branch to your current branch
