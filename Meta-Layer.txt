Metadata is the core of the Yocto Project. Metadata has several important subdivisions:
- meta/classes/
These directories contain the .bbclass files. Class files are used to abstract common code so it can be reused by
multiple packages. Every package inherits the base file.

- meta/conf/
This directory contains the core set of configuration files that start from bitbake.conf and from which all other configuration
files are included. 

- meta/conf/machine/
This directory contains all the machine configuration files. If you set MACHINE = "qemux86", the OpenEmbedded
build system looks for a qemux86.conf file in this directory.

- meta/conf/distro/
The contents of this directory controls any distribution-specific configurations. For the Yocto Project, the defaultsetup.
conf is the main file here. This directory includes the versions and the SRCDATE definitions for applications
that are configured here.

- meta/conf/machine-sdk/
The OpenEmbedded build system searches this directory for configuration files that correspond to the value of SDKMACHINE.
By default, 32-bit and 64-bit x86 files ship with the Yocto Project that support some SDK hosts.

- meta/files/
This directory contains common license files and several text files used by the build system. The text files contain minimal
device information and lists of files and directories with known permissions.

- meta/lib/
This directory contains OpenEmbedded Python library code used during the build process. It is enabled via the addpylib
directive in meta/conf/local.conf.

- meta/recipes-bsp/
This directory contains anything linking to specific hardware or hardware configuration information such as "u-boot"
and "grub".

- meta/recipes-connectivity/
This directory contains libraries and applications related to communication with other devices.

- meta/recipes-core/
This directory contains what is needed to build a basic working Linux image including commonly used dependencies.

- meta/recipes-devtools/
This directory contains tools that are primarily used by the build system.

- meta/recipes-extended/
This directory contains non-essential applications that add features compared to the alternatives in core. You might need
this directory for full tool functionality.

- meta/recipes-gnome/
This directory contains all things related to the GTK+ application framework.

- meta/recipes-graphics/
This directory contains X and other graphically related system libraries.

- meta/recipes-kernel/
This directory contains the kernel and generic applications and libraries that have strong kernel dependencies.

- meta/recipes-multimedia/
This directory contains codecs and support utilities for audio, images and video.

- meta/recipes-rt/
This directory contains package and image recipes for using and testing the PREEMPT_RT kernel.

- meta/recipes-sato/
This directory contains the Sato demo/reference UI/UX and its associated applications and configuration data.

- meta/recipes-support/
This directory contains recipes used by other recipes, but that are not directly included in images (i.e. dependencies of
other recipes).

- meta/site/
This directory contains a list of cached results for various architectures. Because certain "autoconf" test results cannot
be determined when cross-compiling due to the tests not able to run on a live system, the information in this directory is
passed to 􀁯autoconf􀁰for the various architectures.
