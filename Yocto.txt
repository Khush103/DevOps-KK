Hello Myself!! Definitions to Learn!!!

-----Yocto---------
- an `open-source project` that provides templates, tools and methods to create your own `custom Linux distributions` for embedded systems.

Yocto includes 3 key components - 

- `BitBake` - build engine

- `poky` - reference distribution

- `Layers` - OE core - functionality



###----BUILD YOUR OWN IMAGE---###
git clone -b kirkstone git://git.yoctoproject.org/poky -> clone the poky repo (reference distribution for Yocto)
cd poky
source oe-init-build-env  -> set up the build environment
# edit conf/local.conf to set up your hardware as needed
bitbake core-image-minimal # bitbake builds an image, find the built image in build/tmp/deploy/images/<machine>/
