Hello Myself!! Definitions to Learn!!!

-----Yocto---------
- an `open-source project` that provides templates, tools and methods to create your own `custom Linux distributions` for embedded systems.

Yocto includes 3 key components - 

- `BitBake` - build engine

- apt - advanced packaging tool

- `poky` - reference distribution

- `Layers` - OE core - functionality
- bitbake-layers create-layer meta-mylayer -> to create your own layer

-  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## base-layer -->> its the Foundation for the build system
- provided by yocto/poky
- base layer provides core functionality and definitions
- includes essential BitBake recipes, core classes, basic machine configurations
- standard tasks like building the kernal, busybox etc

## meta-layer -->> plugins that sit on the top of the base layer
- we can create our own meta-layer
- provides add-on functionality
- adds features, customisations or, supports new hardwares
- contains optional recipes, machines, configs 

## Configuration Files: 
- Files which hold global definitions of variables, user defined variables and hardware configuration information. 
- They tell the build system what to build and put into the image to support a particular platform.

## Recipe: 
- The most common form of metadata. A recipe will contain a list of settings and tasks (instructions) for building packages which are then used to build the binary image. 
- A recipe describes where you get source code and which patches to apply. 
- Recipes describe dependencies for libraries or for other recipes, as well as configuration and compilation options. 
- They are stored in layers.
- Files that have the .bb suffix are recipes files.

## Layer: 
- A collection of related recipes. 
- Layers allow you to consolidate related metadata to customize your build, and isolate information for multiple architecture builds. 
- Layers are hierarchical in their ability to override previous specifications. 
- You can include any number of available layers from the Yocto Project and customize the build by adding your layers after them. 
- The Layer Index is searchable for layers within Yocto Project.

## Metadata: 
- A key element of the Yocto Project is the meta-data which is used to construct a Linux distribution, contained in the files that the build system parses when building an image. 
- In general, Metadata includes recipes, configuration files and other information referring to the build instructions themselves, as well as the data used to control what things get built and to affect how they are built. 
- The meta-data also includes commands and data used to indicate what versions of software are used, and where they are obtained from, as well as changes or additions to the software itself (patches or auxiliary files) which are used to fix bugs or customize the software for use in a particular situation. 
- OpenEmbedded Core is an important set of validated metadata.

## OpenEmbedded-Core: 
- oe-core is meta-data composed of foundation recipes, classes and associated files that are meant to be common among many different OpenEmbedded-derived systems, including the Yocto Project. 
- It is a curated subset of an original repository developed by the OpenEmbedded community which has been pared down into a smaller, core set of continuously validated recipes resulting in a tightly controlled and a quality-assured core set of recipes.

## Poky: A reference embedded distribution and a reference test configuration created to 
1) provide a base level functional distro which can be used to illustrate how to customize a distribution, 
2) to test the Yocto Project components, Poky is used to validate Yocto Project, and 
3) as a vehicle for users to download Yocto Project. 
- Poky is not a product level distro, but a good starting point for customization. Poky is an integration layer on top of oe-core.

## Build System – “Bitbake”: a scheduler and execution engine which parses instructions (recipes) and configuration data. 
- It then creates a dependency tree to order the compilation, schedules the compilation of the included code, and finally, executes the building of the specified, custom Linux image (distribution). 
- BitBake is a make-like build tool. 
- BitBake recipes specify how a particular package is built. 
- They include all the package dependencies, source code locations, configuration, compilation, build, install and remove instructions. 
- Recipes also store the metadata for the package in standard variables. 
- Related recipes are consolidated into a layer. 
- During the build process dependencies are tracked and native or cross-compilation of the package is performed. 
- As a first step in a cross-build setup, the framework will attempt to create a cross-compiler toolchain (Extensible SDK) suited for the target platform.

## Packages: The output of the build system used to create your final image.

## Extensible Software Development Kit (ESDK): A custom SDK for application developers that allows them to incorporate their library and programming changes back into the image to make their code available to other apps developers.

## Image: A binary form of a Linux distribution (operating system) intended to be loaded onto a device.

-------------- The General “Workflow” — How It All Works--------------------
- To begin, developers specify architecture, policies, patches and configuration details.
- The build system then fetches and downloads the source code from where ever specified. The project supports standard methods such as tarballs or source code repositories systems such as git.
- Once downloaded, the sources are extracted into a local work area where patches are applied and common steps for configuring and compiling the software will be run.
- The software is then installed into a temporary staging area where the binary package format you select (deb, rpm, or ipk) will be used to roll up the software.
- Different QA and sanity checks are run throughout entire build process.
- After the binaries are created, a binary package feed is generated which is then used to create the final root file image.
- The file system image is generated.
- When using Yocto Project, this workflow will change depending on what components and tools are actually being used.


### Package vs Recipe: A recipe contains instructions the build system uses to create packages. Recipes and Packages are the difference between the front end and the result of the build process.

------------Distro Layer-----------------
• classes: Class files (.bbclass) hold common functionality that can be shared among recipes in the distribution.
When your recipes inherit a class, they take on the settings and functions for that class. 

• conf: This area holds configuration files for the layer (conf/layer.conf), the distribution (conf/distro/
distro.conf), and any distribution-wide include files.

• recipes-:* Recipes and append files that affect common functionality across the distribution. This area could include
recipes and append files to add distribution-specific configuration, initialization scripts, custom image recipes, and
so forth. 
- Examples of recipes-* directories are recipes-core and recipes-extra. 
- Hierarchy and contents within a recipes-* directory can vary. Generally, these directories contain recipe files (*.bb), recipe append files (*.bbappend), directories that are distro-specific for configuration files, and so forth.

--------------BSP Layer---------------------
- The BSP Layer provides machine configurations that target specific hardware. Everything in this layer is specific to the
machine for which you are building the image or the SDK.
- The BSP Layers configuration directory contains configuration files for the machine (conf/machine/machine.conf)
and, of course, the layer (conf/layer.conf).
- The remainder of the layer is dedicated to specific recipes by function: recipes-bsp, recipes-core, recipes-graphics, recipes-kernel, and so forth. There can be metadata for multiple formfactors, graphics support, systems, and so forth.

-------------Software Layer------------------
- The software layer provides the Metadata for additional software packages used during the build. 
- This layer does not include Metadata that is specific to the distribution or the machine, which are found in their respective layers.
- This layer contains any recipes, append files, and patches, that your project needs.
